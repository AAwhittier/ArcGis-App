# Overview

This is an Android app created to interface with ArcGis to show the user a map and allows them to
search for a location on the map to be displayed. It was created with the intent to become familiar
with both ArcGis and the android workflow.

The app currently has two screens, one to allow you to view the map, move, and zoom in. The other
will allows you to search for a coordinate on the map and move the map to that location.
